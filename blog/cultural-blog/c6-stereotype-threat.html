      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Whats going on?</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>A stereotype threat is the effect of being constantly bombarded by negative stereotypes about groups that you belong to.  The price of this increased stress while while completing tasks tied to that stereotype.  Some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">common examples of stereotype threats</a> that affect people are ethnic minorities in academic environments, women in negotiation and driving, LGBT individuals in child rearing, white men in sports, and, most appropriate in tech, women and ethnic minorities in coding.  Cladue Steele, the originator of the theory, explains the effects thusly:</p>
      <blockquote cite='http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/'>"When you feel under threat, you know that based on an identity you have, something bad could happen.  You don’t know whether in fact it will happen. You don’t know precisely what could happen or when or where it could happen.  It’s like having a snake loose in the house. It’s a terrible feeling. When you are in this situation, most of your cognitive resources are devoted to vigilance." ...  "If you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing.  In a situation like this, it takes cognitive resources away from a relaxed engagement with the task at hand and that undermines your performance."</blockquote>
      <p class='body-copy'>Stereotype threat puts pressure on individuals at points that are vulnerable and causes their performance to drop.  We can all probably think about a case where self-doubt coupled with what society has been telling us culminates in a perfect storm of stress designed to throw us off of our game.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Where did this idea come from?</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>As mentioned earlier, Cladue Steele, currently a professor at Stanford, originated the theory of stereotype threat.  In the early 1990's he was a young professor at the University of Michigan.  He was perplexed by the differing achievement levels for black and white students: even after controlling socio-economic indicators black students were 20% to 25% more likely to drop out of school than whites.  Prof. Steele conducted a series of tests to study different <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_%28psychology%29">priming effects</a> and to suss out the imprint of the stereotype threat he hypothesized.  He found it accounted for much of the achievement gap that was identified.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/criticisms.html">Many subsequent tests</a> have also come to similar conclusions.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>How can I fight stereotype threat in my own life?</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/about_us.html">Reducingsterotypethreat.org</a> has an excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html">list of strategies</a> for fighting the effects of stereotype threat.  Their tactics include mentally re-framing in a more positive mindset, encouraging self affirmation, and having positive role models.</p>
