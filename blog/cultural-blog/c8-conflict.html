      <p class='body-copy'>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>When I moved out to Montana I made a concerted effort to stay in close touch with my friends and family back east.  This involved calling and texting people regularly.  My sister in particular didn't like this and started ignoring my calls.  This upset me.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>2. What was the source of the conflict?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>I wanted to fell connected to what was going on in her life but she wanted to check in less frequently.  My calls became a burden that were to be avoided and I felt increasingly out of touch and frustrated.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>I felt a sense of disconnection from where I had grown up and that was driving some behavior that was unusual for me.  I guess you could say I was feeling lonely.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>I tried bringing it up with my sister but she got defensive, so I went back and analyzed why I was feeling frustrated with her and found that much of the fault lay with me.  I apologized and now I call my sister much less but talk to her much more.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>I would probably be more understanding of her emotions and what she wanted than I was at the time.  </p>
      <p class='body-copy'>6. What did you learn from this experience?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Patience is important and frustration and anger are not productive emotions in most circumstances.</p>
