      <p class='body-copy'>When I was applying for DBC I saw references to things like the 'feedbackinator' and 'pairing sessions.'  I knew what feedback was, but not a feedbackinator, and I had a very fuzzy idea of how the word pairing applied to learning to code.  Now were are more than half way through with Phase 0 and I have a much better idea about both of these parts of the program and how they help in the learning process.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Feedback and pairing are inherently social activities, and it is that aspect of DBC that is much more formalized and integrated into the curriculum than any other class I have ever taken.  I really like it.  Today I am going to write about my experience so far with both the feedback and pairing aspects of Dev Bootcamp.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Pairing</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Going to school I was, like most, habituated to working in groups.  We had meetings, went off on our own and worked on our parts and then had another meeting to synthesize our work.  Working in a pairing session is a much more intimate way to work with someone else.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Sharing your thoughts step-by-step as you think though a problem and constantly soliciting feedback from your pairing is a whole different ballgame than most kinds of group work.  It is much more closely analogous to cooking a large meal with, or trying to build a shed with someone.  You are all in each others space and good communication is key.  I personally like this kind of collaboration.  The pairing sessions, a part of the program that I was initially hesitant about, have become something that I look forward to every week.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Considering the feedback I have gotten and my personal observations, I want to work on being a better pair moving forward.  Slowing down, and more clearly/concisely communicating my ideas are two areas where I think I can easily increase my efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Feedback</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>As mentioned above, the formalized feedback system in place at DBC, is out of the ordinary.  Every time we pair with anyone we are expected to write a short paragraph or two describing the experience and offering any feedback that is A.S.K. (actionable, specific, and kind) up to the feedbackinator.  This will only give the feedback to the recipient if it is rated by others as A.S.K.  This makes accepting criticism much easier.  When you know that the feedback you are getting is constructive it makes it much easier to act on it.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>I have some tendencies that make following my screen difficult; highlighting things as I read them, rapidly switching windows, or scrolling past things that I already know.  I had someone point this out to me as feedback on one of my pairing sessions, making me realize something that I was doing mainly subconsciously.  I have since then made a concerted effort to make my screen a more habitable place for people peeking in on it, hopefully making for a better pairing experience.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>The pairing and feedback aspects of the DBC curriculum are definitely strong points of the program, and something that I personally get a lot of value from.</p>
