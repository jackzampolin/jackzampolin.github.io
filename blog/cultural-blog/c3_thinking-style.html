      <p class='body-copy'>This week the pocket gophers are finishing up their third week of class and their first whole unit!  Week one was spent setting things up and introducing a number of basic competiencies.  Week two was primarily HTML/CSS, and this week we did a nice Ruby refresher.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Seeing that we will be moving into Unit 2 of Phase 0 next week, this might be a good time to stop and look back at what is working and what is not.  That got me me thinking about the Gregorc Thinking Styles we talked about in week 1.  I was evenly split between Concrete Random and Abstract Random.  After reading the descriptions of the two I was surprised how accurate they were.  Below is a brief description of the two styles.  I found a lot of the information on thinking styles <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> if you would like to see it for yourself.  You can also take the test <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Concrete Random</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Concrete Random (CR) thinkers like to experiment, take risks, use their intuition and solve problems independently.  They chaffe under restrictions and limitations, formal reports and routines, and not having options.  Concrete random thinkers learn best when they can experiment, compete and take the time to work through problems for themselves.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'><h2>Abstract Random</h2></p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Abstract Random (AR) thinkers like to work in group situations and work to establish good working relationships with their peers.  They like to focus on the issues at hand an work toward resolving them.  They have trouble with authoritarian personalities, restrictive work environments, poor working relationships, and accepting criticism.  AR thinkers learn best when in a friendly, personalized environment, and perfer broad/open-ended project guidelines.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>How does that apply to me?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>As I mentioned earlier I was surprised at how accurate some of these atributes were.  I do definately have an independent, anti-authority streak in me that has at different times in my life done more harm than good.  I like to think I would work best in a colaboraive environment where experimentation and asking questions is encouraged and that is also what my thinking styles would suggest.  I have not had any serious problems learning and understanding the material as of yet so I don't think there is anything I need to change right now.  It seems that the way I learn is very similar to the way DBC teaches which is AWESOME.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>The biggest struggle I had initally was opening up and joining the community in my class.  Luckily, I have found the DBC community fantastic.  I was initally sceptical about making friends and connections during the remote period, but the different chats and groups I am in have done a fantastic job of building an open community where we can easily discuss the things that we are working on and problems we might have.  It also helps that I like everyone I have met so far.  I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone in person.</p><br>
