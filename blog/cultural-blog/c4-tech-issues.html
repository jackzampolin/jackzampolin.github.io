      <p class='body-copy'>The tech world is currently in a period unprecedented of growth.  This is hardly news.  The evidence of this impressive spurt of creativity and productivity is all around us.  The smartphones that never leave our side,  our laptops, the ever expanding Internet Of Things, the list goes on.  Industry media is full of reports of huge funding rounds for <a href="http://www.magicleap.com/#/home">companies still in stealth</a> and even fanciful creatures like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/">Unicorns</a>.  It seems like money is piling into <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/15/startups-late-stage-valuations-and-bull/">tech financing rounds</a> at unprecedented levels.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Young entrepreneurs are piling into accelerators like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news"></a>Y-Combinator.  Ivy league grads are adding Tech as a career option to the traditional professional fields of Medicine, Business, and Law.  As the famous venture investor Marc Andreessen said <a href="http://www.aberdeeninvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Why-Software-Is-Eating-The-World-8-20-111.pdf">'software is eating the world'</a> and everyone wants to get a piece of the action.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>The underlying case for continued growth in the industry is very strong.  Inventing and distributing disruptive technologies is a business that will always be strong.  From railroads, telegraphs, and radio, to televisions, and telephones the last two centuries have comprehensively argued that technology will continue to march on, and being there first will be wildly remunerative.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>But there is an <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/22/tech-unicorns-is-it-a-bubble/">elephant in the room</a>.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Memories from the last tech bubble still influence those who went through it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things-ebook/dp/B00DQ845EA"><i>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</i></a>, by Ben Horowitz, has a great story of what one company went through in the last bubble.  A promising start by a valley darling turned into multiple massive layoffs, wrenching pivots to entirely new products and markets, and epic fights to raise money.  It makes for great reading and a heroic story.  But it should be read a cautionary tale.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDls5C4a_kU">Winter is coming.</a>  Eventually.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>While I personally believe that the fundamentals and future of this industry are rock solid, I am going to DBC after all, it is important to respect the business cycle.  While it may not be this year or next, winter is coming eventually.</p>
