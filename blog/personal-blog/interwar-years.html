      </p>
      <p>The current conflict in the Crimea has long historical antecedents.  The situation is much grayer than the American media would have you believe.  Consider the parallel between Russia today and Germany between the World Wars. </p>

      <p>Before World War I the world was separated into spheres of influence of the Great Powers.  The Aachen Regime that had held sway in Europe for centuries still held sway.  After the fall of the Axis, two superpowers divided the world and all the great powers of the previous centuries had fallen by the wayside.  Germany, a country that was so great that it took an alliance of all of the other powers two tries to fully defeat, was reduced to a fragmented form reminiscent of its feudal past.  These great geopolitical changes paled in comparison to human cost of the wars. </p>

      <p>The territorial and human cost of the Cold War, the third great war of the 20th century, was also staggering.  America, the victor, broke up the Soviet Empire (or the Evil Empire as Ronald Regan called it).  After the Cold War, Russia was reduced in size from 22.4 million km2 to just over 17 million km2.  And as a consequence, its population was reduced from 293 million people in 1991 to 143 million today.  Taking advantage of Russian weakness, America pushed its nuclear umbrella as far east as the Baltic nations.  These nations directly border Russia.  So, rightly or wrongly, Russia views NATO expansion as an atomic sword pointed at its throat. </p>

      <p>In America we have little appreciation of Russia’s struggles over the past century.  Post World War II America rode the massive spending instituted by allied countries that enabled them to get out of the Great Depression.  A comparatively small number of Americans died during the war, leaving the nation stronger and more united than when the war began.  The end of the war ushered in an era of prosperity unprecedented in human history.  America spent a declining share of GDP on military spending throughout the Cold War, peaking over 10% during the first years of the Korean Conflict and declining to around 5% during the Regan years. </p>

      <p>On the other hand, Russia suffered grievously during World War II.  The Russians lost an estimated 22 to 28 million men, women and children, between 11% and 14% of the overall population.  After the war the country was forced to spend a massive share of GDP to keep up with American military spending.  Even in the late ‘80s, in the heyday of Glasnost, the USSR was spending upwards of a quarter of GDP on their military.  That fell to almost nothing after 1991.  These huge numbers, as always, don’t even come close to showing the impact on ordinary Russians’ lives.</p>

      <p>Today, a resurgent Russia is rearming.  Refueled by limitless hydrocarbon resources the government is once again strong.  Putin seems to be following in Hitler’s footsteps.  The obvious parallel is frightening.  Using the “oppressed” German minority as an excuse for intervention was a favorite tactic of Hitler’s.  Putin seems to be using similar tactics.</p>

      <p>The parallel methods dovetail with the historical similarities.  Russia plays the role of a wounded but not defeated Germany looking to reassert itself.  America plays the role of the old European allies trying to maintain their large colonial interests.  China is a rising regional power with a strong isolationist constituency.</p>

      <p>Against this combustible backdrop, crisis unfolds in the Ukraine, an area that has historically been a part of Russia. The American press, almost to a man, wonders what we can do to prevent Putin from annexing the whole country.  Obama’s ineffectual protests look remarkably similar to Neville Chamberlain’s reaction to the Anschluss.  Highbrow policy publications like The Economist and Foreign Affairs, while they have moderated their stances in recent weeks as they realized the consequences of what they were advocating, cry out for actions like the defense of the Western-supported Kiev government or the extension of NATO to Russia’s southern borders.</p>

      <p>Viewed from any lens besides the complacent and soft prevailing opinion in American this is a situation that calls for measured responses, especially considering Russia still has the world’s largest atomic weapons stockpile.  I certainly can’t predict what will happen in Ukraine or the rest of Eastern Europe once the West’s weakness and complacency is laid bare as Putin annexes the Crimea, but if history is any guide, policy makers should tread carefully.</p>

      <p>I am trying to present this history as a way of framing a more balanced narrative of what is going on the Crimea, not as an exercise in drawing conclusions about the current situation.  I hope it is read that way.</p>
