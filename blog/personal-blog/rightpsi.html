      </p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Why is tire pressure important?  The tires provide the four crucial patches where a car connects with the road.  Underinflated tires reduce the cornering, braking, and accelerating abilities of the car, thereby impacting safety.  NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Saftey Administration) estimates 200,000 crashes, 33,000 injuries and 660 deaths in the US every year are directly attributable to underinflated tires.  Low tire pressure also reduces gas mileage and tire life, costing the drivers money and negatively impacting the environment through increased emissions and tire particulate matter.  On average, properly inflated tires increase fuel economy by 3.3%.  Underinflated tires cause the waste of 3.5 million gallons of gas daily.  These are some of the reasons why the government mandated TPMS on all passenger cars starting in 2007.<p>

      <p class='body-copy'>Modern TPMS displays have two different readouts.  The mandated light on the dash is standard on all cars.  Most cars also have a direct reading of tire pressure buried in the electronic user interface for the car.  This readout gives exact pressures for all tires on the car, allowing drivers to check their pressure from behind the steering wheel.  The problem with this two pronged approach is that the light does not indicate until 25% underinflation.  This leaves the exact readout a couple levels down in the user interface of the car; out of sight and out of mind.</p>

      <p class='body-copy'>What are the strengths of TPMS vs. an on-tire indicator?  The primary advantage of TPMS is a timely warning of catastrophic tire failure.  In the event of rapid tire deflation, TPMS does an excellent job of informing the driver while the car is moving.  This is a function that is difficult for an on-tire indicator to match.  Catastrophic deflations that resulted in the 2000 Firestone Recall were a driving force behind the momentum that brought the TREAD Act into existence.  Another strength of TPMS is the ability to remind the driver in a persistent but passive way of the importance of checking tire pressure.</p>

      <p class='body-copy'>What are the weaknesses of TPMS vs. an on-tire indicator?  There are numerous commonly recognized problems with TPMS.  A main complaint from drivers and dealers is the price.  At the retail level, replacement sensors for GM cars range from $50 to $70 per sensor.  The sensors necessitate replacement every time a battery runs out or a sensor is damaged.  It is recommended to replace the valves on the sensor every time the tires are rotated.  The sensors then need to be reset, an operation for which most dealers charge.  These costs add up for the car owner, causing frustration. </p>

      <p class='body-copy'>Price is an issue as well at the dealer level.  The government mandates that all TPMS must be fully functional when serviced cars leave the bays, leading to unsatisfied customers and unexpected costs for dealers.  The dealers also have to maintain sufficient stock of TPMS components, proper tools and equipment, requiring additional investment.  Many of these items are low margin, contributing to dealer frustration.  Another weakness of TPMS is insufficient driver understanding of the alerts the system provides.  In a recently released (9 April 2014) study, Schrader revealed the lack of awareness of the function of TPMS on the part of average drivers.  Forty two percent of drivers surveyed did not know that the dashboard warning light indicated a TPMS alert.  This is despite the fact that the overwhelming majority (92%) of drivers recognize that underinflated tires are a “serious safety issue”.</p>

      <p class='body-copy'>There is a fundamental disconnect in drivers’ minds between their undertstanding of tire pressure and its importance, and the efforts being made to increase awareness and safety.  We believe part of this disconnect is in the logical/analytical approach to tire pressure currently embodied in TPMS.  The on/off light and the exact digital display speak very much to the logical side of the driver’s brain, while not reaching their visceral/experiential side.  The needle jumping as a driver progresses through the gears imparts an excellent experiential understanding of speed.  Numbers on a digital read-out going from 0-60 do not.  Digital tire pressure displays have an understanding gap for the same reason that digital read-out speedometers have an understanding gap.</p>

      <p class='body-copy'>The visual indication offered by RightPSI gives a visceral understanding of tire pressure that TPMS fails to impart.  The little band of orange prompts the driver to begin thinking about putting air in his tires.  RightPSI caps will also alert sooner than the TPMS light which comes on when one tire is 25% underinflated.  RightPSI begins indicating at +-5% and reaches full indication at 20% underinflated.  This easily comprehensive, properly sensitive cap does a much better job at impressing a visceral understanding of the meaning of low tire pressure to a driver. </p>

      <p class='body-copy'>RightPSI’s simple, well-designed product addresses the main problems with TPMS.  The most obvious of these is the RightPSI’s fill-through feature.  This removes a lot of the hassle involved when filling tires.  There is no need to think about what pressure the tires require (something that most people don’t know off the top of their head), no finding a tire pressure gauge, no taking the gauge on and off to find the right pressure.  All of these steps of the process are eliminated.  Just fill until the cap reads full.  This functionality would be especially useful for drivers with limited mobility - an increasingly large market. </p>

      <p class='body-copy'>RightPSI is very cost competitive with TPMS.  The cost to the OEM for a TPMS system appears to be around $100 per car.  Adding RightPSI stems would be a fraction of the cost of TPMS.  This is a small marginal cost for a large marginal gain in utility.  Unlike TPMS, RightPSIs require no maintenance. The caps also add a novel and useful functionality to new vehicles.  RightPSI caps could also be a great source of add-on sales for dealers.  They could be easily sold as a way to protect the customer’s investment, keep his family safe, and save money.  The caps pay for themselves in just five months based on gasoline saved by having properly inflated tires.  If integrated into the tire stem, RightPSI may be able to help make cars greener, a long-held goal of all auto companies. </p>

      <p class='body-copy'>For all these reasons stated, we believe that RightPSI would be a great fit for any auto OEM, especially in an environment in which all new cars have TPMS.</p>
