    <p>I loved hearing Shereef explain why he started Dev Bootcamp.  Its a story I have heard before, but its always nice to hear it from the horses mouth.  The different mindsets he spoke about at the beginning, restaurant and kitchen, hit home for me.  I spent 4 years after college working to become a great professional chef, so that world is close to my heart.</p>
    <p>The mindset of the customer, what Shereef calls the restaurant mindset, is inherently reactionary.  You have to be presented the menu of choices.  This limits your thinking by giving your mind a number of preset options.  Creativity and original work does not come from selecting from a set of preset options.  It comes from exploring options NOT on the menu.  It comes from working hard at your craft, and honing your skills.  It comes from serendipitous moments that will only happen if you have the prerequisite knowledge.</p>
    <p>When you run into a tube of anchovy paste in the back of your pantry you might not know what to do with it.  But through experimentation and research you can easily make your food taste better with it. (Try putting some in the next tomato sauce you make.  Its like the Italian version of Fish Sauce.)  I imagine that learning coding is somewhat similar.  Each language, method, framework is like an ingredient or a tool.  You start by making simple things, like this blog, and you end up being able to make curried lamb ravioli with mushroom puree, roasted cauliflower florets, and kale chips.</p>
    <p>The learning process to get to develop specific skills where you can start creating with those skills is, in my experience, inherently personal and holistic and I LOVE that DBC views it that way as well.  I could not be more excited to start this program especially after doing the week 1 exercises.  Visually this page gives me a bit of anxiety.  Immediately after I turn in this week's work later I will be learning enough HTML and CSS to make this site look halfway decent.</p>
    <p>I am an avid reader, and I have a feeling these cultural blogs will touch on subjects I have seen before.  I will try and add a couple of books at the bottom of each to help illuminate the subject further.</p>
