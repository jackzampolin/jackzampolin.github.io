      <p class='body-copy'>* What are the benefits of version control?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Version control allows you to have multiple copies of a file with changes to each and merge them back together.  When you have an operating environment that a lot of people rely on, say a bankâ€™s servers, the code has to always work. Software development seems to be iterative in nature. Making mistakes and pushing to a better solution are one in the same. The problem with these competing imperatives is easily solved by version control. The engineer can easily have multiple versions to play with, test, improve while leaving the original intact. It also allows her to easily merge her final changes into the production environment.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>* How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Once you initialize git on a specific file, git will automatically keep track of all changes on that file.  You can easily go in after changes are made and run the $ git status command.  This will show all changes made to the file since the last commit.  Git also allows you to create branches of the same file and merge them all together.  It has all of the attributes you would want in a version control software.</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>* Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>
      <p class='body-copy'>Git is a program for your computer just like any other. It allows you to easily keep track of different version of specific files and easily merge them back into one file. Very similar to the track changes function on MS Word. GitHub is an online service that hosts central files that can be edited by multiple parties and all the changes can be easily incorporated into a final version. So by analogy GitHub is like a Google Doc that everyone can edit and the changes can be incorporated into a final version. GitHub also has a social component that the developer community uses as a calling card.  It also gives the developer the advantage of being able to work from any terminal as the central repository should be the most up to date.</p>
