      <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        When two programmers work together to create or improve code.  In this collaborative process there are two roles a driver and a navigator.  These roles are fluid and can switch multiple times during a pair session.

      <h2>Comparison of Driver and Navigator Roles</h2>
      <h4>Driver</h4>
      <p>The driver is the one on the keyboard doing the physical typing of the code.  Their role is to be in the weeds and ensure the correct syntax is being used and that the program will succesfully compile/run.</p>
      <h4>Navigator</h4>
      <p>The navigator is responsible for ensuring that the driver is on the right course and assisting the driver in any way they can.  They primarily help with looking up methods or routines to accomplish the task at hand or review the brief.

      <h2>Importance of Pair Programming at DBC</h2>
      <p>
        One of the primary benefits is that having two sets of eyes on the code will reduce mistakes.  Pair programming is becoming more popular across the industry and DBC wants to expose us to this process.  Having two people prevents signifcant writer's block and helps keep up the energy and focus of both team members.

<!-- I had a great pair from the Chicago cohort for this challange!  I thought we worked well together.  He started off driving and set up the HTML and wrote the copy for the page.  The discussion was very fluid and I thought he was clearly up to speed on everything.  I drove for the CSS portion and was able to easily implement some solutions I had used earlier in the week for my personal site to make everything work.  We went with a really basic, centered, fluid layout.  We decided to call it about 10 min after our guide left.  I think we both had a pretty good understanding of the material covered in this GPS! -->
